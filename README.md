# Project-Primero
An arena brawler inspired by Super Smash Brothers and Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS)

The purpose of this project is two fold:
to act as my first original game and,
to be the framework of a more comprehensive arena brawler I'd like to make down the road

Mechanically, this game will be very similar to Super Smash Brothers. 
Some mechanics and the character design of the game will be inspired by RPS however.
